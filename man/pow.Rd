\title{Generic Power Function}
\usage{
pow(x, a, plot_it = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector to raise to some power.}

\item{a}{Power to raise \code{x} by.}

\item{plot_it}{Display a plot of \code{x} vs the output? Use logical.}
}
\value{
The vector \code{x}, raised to the power of \code{a}.
}
\description{
This function raises a vector to any power. I'm making it internal,
by not \code{export}ing, because I don't want users to use it.
Why not? Because I said so!
}
\details{
Yingying made some changes here. Added a default value to the
parameter \code{plot_it=FALSE}, as the generic power function
is frequently used in Box Cox Transformation functions and
Box Cox Inverse functions
}
